564	#treat is awesome, but #trick is more fun.
564	You can learn a lot about how people see you by how you're listed. For example, it seems that people feel strongly that I work at Twitter.
564	I'm not sure when I switched from reading books in bed just before going to sleep to checking email, but I don't think it's healthy.
564	Another headphones cable on the fritz. I need to buy these things in bulk.
564	@handle Get a magical parking card. http://bit.ly/zpKsH Available pre-tax through WageWorks.
564	Ok then. I'm just going to hold off for a little while and react to this later.
564	I'm beginning to think this day would have gone better if I had started it differently. Mainly if I'd skipped the getting out of bed part.
564	I just finished season one of The Tudors, and omg you guys--you'll never believe how it ends!
564	@handle Perhaps ideal for the undead.
564	It's a good thing I have this never-ending mountain of email to sort though. Otherwise waiting on these tests would be boh-rring.
564	I want there to be substantially less waiting in my day to day life.
564	Embroidery: cooler than you would think.
564	@handle called me a "pretty little hate machine". It made me blush.
564	"Don't cloud the wonder of this week with your little ...facts."
564	I block for misdirected @ replies.
564	@handle No. I would burn alive contentedly at my laptop without ever having heard the fire alarm.
564	Finally figured it out. There's only one escalator at this Bart station. It changes direction depending on the time of day.
564	I'm watching the shipping casualty of this move hasten to its doom from the tracking page. Poor little guy. He has no idea what he's in for.
564	@handle Wow. Just... wow.
564	Took a chance on some molasses clove cookies. Oh yeaaah, I live on the wild side. And it's tasty here.
564	@handle What timezone are you in? Because if being up at 11pm makes you an insomniac then... *pats your head*
564	@handle Yes, and then she loaned it to me. But I can assure you, we both knew what we were getting into.
564	Anyone who believes that you cannot judge a book by its cover has not seen the cover of this book: http://amzn.com/0373621353
564	The prospect of a new office on Monday fills me with the kind of hope that scares me. (That is, any.)
564	Just remembered my stressful dream. I sure hope @handle isn't mad at me still.
564	@handle Well, hello fellow moocher. Thanks for getting to it so quickly!
564	Today in cute: Cinder eats with his hands. Scoops up each piece of kibble with his paw and head tilted, daintily dishes it into his mouth.
564	Nothing will make you realize just how dumb something is as trying to explain it to someone else.
564	The one thing that USPS has on UPS, FedEx and all other carriers: the forwarding address.
564	"We sincerely appreciate your feedback. But please note, there is a 250 character limit. Max exceeded." Turns out I only needed four.
564	I'm going to be a full hour late to this thing. My only excuse? C'mon, it's Saturday.
564	Donated to a public artistic preformance for the first time in years. It was both striking and silent.
564	Thinking warm, congratulatory thoughts towards the people who made that thing happen. You know who you are.
564	@handle Never Forget.
564	Abandoned cat is abandoned. http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/pet/1451640811.html Please adopt or RT.
564	Alright, that's it. Today calls for cookies.
564	I need something to cheer me up from my somber contemplation. Oh, this economics book will do quite nicely. What? "Dismal" is realtive.
564	Wanted: a lightweight, fast, simple note taking web app that stores to the cloud and is on iphone. Note: omnifocus does not qualify AT ALL.
564	@handle That is exactly as it should be.
564	Whatever. It'll be like paypal. We'll just hire lots of laywers.
564	What ever happened to smelling salts anyway? Oh. "Ammonia gas is toxic in large concentrations for prolonged periods, and can be fatal..."
564	GENIUS money making idea: An alarm clock that involves smelling salts.
564	Alright you guys, I let you have your fun. But it's November--it's time to put the sun away now.
564	@handle I don't get the hate people have for Nickelback. Sure, they're poppy and derivative--but since when does that inspire such rage?
564	@handle Critical mass represents almost, but not quite everything that I hate about San Francisco.
564	@handle I get that all the time. I block the misguided souls so they no longer appear in my timeline. (Their updates, not their souls.)
3039	@handle Not a cool joke! I got pretty pissed for a split second! :)
3039	WOW! This morning has been a roller coaster! But I'm in such a great mood :D
3039	Feeling good. Just helped a little boy catch his runaway dog. :)

3039	:D! @handle RT @handle: @handle wow, uli is the luckiest man on earth. :)
3039	@handle You know, punching bags do punch back :) Hope your day gets better.
3039	@handle Some things just aren't meant to mix... and other are :D Like football and sex :D
3039	@handle It's got everything you need: football and sex :D
3039	@handle Thanks! :D If you need an extra body at your practices, let me know :) Just throwing it out there ;)
3039	@handle Hahaha! Thanks! Def look into it. It's tough, not your typical girlie league.
3039	@handle Couldn't make it, but I tried out last year and want to try out again. :)
3039	@handle Not at all :) I'm all for it!
3039	@handle That's interesting! It's all about relevance.
3039	@handle That would not be fun at all! Do you not like it?
3039	@handle Hell yea! I'm all pumped up now and want to go play!
3039	@handle "What" what?
3039	@handle Ohhhh. How'd it go? What did you discuss?
3039	A quick convo about the Lingerie Football League and I want to go hit a tackling dummy! Grrrrr!
3039	@handle Dude! You have to be wearing three shirts with all three collars popped! @handle @handle
3039	@handle Cool! Looking forward to meeting you in person! :D #SoFlaBlogUp
3039	RT @handle does anyone have a good pic from last night's @handle I can use 4 my column? full cred given (no pay)
3039	Looking forward to @handle's SoFla BlogUp Saturday! Who else is going?

3039	@handle He seems kind of cool 2 me... :P The scruffy look is a good 1 4 him. I just really hope it doesnt get out of hand @handle
3039	@handle I'm glad you didn't try to find out for yourself :)
3039	@handle Which lyric? My fave of his is "I'm not a businessman. I'm a business, man." :D
3039	Someone just told me it's Wednesday. I almost slapped them! Don't mess w/ my days of the week! My dad and bro come in tomorrow!

7736	@handle sounds good.
7736	@handle it says you have to update before I can play you.
7736	@handle sounds good. I might also be downtown tomorrow. That work?
7736	@handle I think it was just a mistake because it wasn't in either listing.
7736	@handle have you checked http://powermax.com or http://macpac.com? They might have one or two.

7736	@handle How did you finagle that? My house wants to know!!! (the fireman boot thing)
7736	@handle As long as you partition it "out of the box" you'll be ready to go when it is time.
7736	@handle Because it's "one and done" instead of "Really? Are you SURE? How about now?"
7736	@handle Lemme know when you're back. I'll forget! (:
7736	@handle Yeah not the nicest price. But if you are gonna, it's easier before you're all "moved in". Set up the partition and install later?

7736	@handle I read those to @handle. He replied: I believe some pies are made simply as whipped cream conveyances. Much like fries for ketchup.
7736	@handle I know it's wordy but I loved The Stand: Uncut. I think the Shining is tight and terrifying. But really, Needful Things.
7736	@handle I'm already suspending disbelief by going along with "let's change the songs we do at Sectionals EVERY TWENTY MINUTES!!" "YEAH!"
7736	@handle Have you read Needful Things? I overshot my bus stop by 50-something blocks when it all got good!
7736	@handle Did you actually say "A toad more specific" or did you typo that?
7736	@handle You are asking Twitter what Posterous is? I think a better website to ask would be Google.
7736	@handle What's wrong with your Denon receiver?
7736	@handle I only expect SUPER OBVIOUS ones. That's the only one I've caught so far since I don't pay attention for plot holes.
7736	#glee question: How is the all girl club gonna win at sectionals? Wasn't there some deal Will had to make to get enough guys to compete?
7736	I want homemade cookies. I don't mind the making, but I don't like to do it alone. Who wants to make cookies with me?

7736	@handle I have braved Black Friday crowds but generally only Kennewick size w/mom! Too much hype and this year I saw no amazing deals.
7736	@handle I'm glad! @handle got to see the Walt Disney Family Museum and he said it was REALLY cool, nice even if you aren't a Disnerd.
7736	@handle I use Google Reader so I just rock the mobile version for the most part. Highly functional since I'm not hardcore on my phone.
7736	@handle Please do. It's SO tasty! Also I like the Cartoon Art Museum and I bet the Walt Disney Fam Museum is amazing. Helpful?
7736	@handle I think you need to send me those recipes! In return I will give you some of the ones I have!

2771	Uhoh - Steve McNanaman sighting!!!
2771	@handle - me too. That was real emotion from AI.
2771	@handle - Instead of handing other packages, perhaps the lady @ the FedEx counter would like to handle your package. Just a thought...
2771	Watching the World Cup draw. Curious to see who's in the Group Of Death.
2771	@handle - South Africa is a sleeper pick. Steven Pienaar is quality and their GK, Itumeleng Khune is real good. Watch for them.
2771	Listening to DeBarge's Greatest Hits. Not El DeBarge -- just Debarge....the whole crew. Serious tunes !
2771	New tunes tonight in DC!!!
2771	@handle - Timbaland knows what he's doing. 1000%.
2771	@handle - on the site now. that tune with Nelly Furtado is HEAVY!
2771	@handle - good point on the $$ thing.
2771	@handle - worse than Whole Foods?
2771	AI press conference, very emotional. #3 belongs in Philly. The AI story will end the way it should.
2771	@handle - finally. a journalist with common sense.
2771	Wookie - Battle. Never gets old. EVER. -> http://bit.ly/XUgwe
2771	@handle - congrats on the new gig! You've got something important to say and radio is the way to do it.
2771	RT @handle: RT @handle: Latest Dub War Podcast is up mixed by Badawi: http://bit.ly/5xb5yw
2771	@handle - Ian Eagle is good, but he's no Gus Johnson...
2771	@handle - you know it bro. this is Baltimore. Life imitating art and vice versa. \
2771	Eto'o is top class, but Ibrahimovic is next level. He has "World Footballer Of The Year" talent. I don't see the same in Eto'o.
2771	@handle - looking forward to the read. thanks...
2771	@handle - can you link us to the column please?
2771	@handle - barca 1 - xerez 0. three more to go...
2771	@handle - true. that's a lot of talent on the bench. I don't have 1/2time Hennessey. Just Gatorade.
2771	@handle - yeah, those are pink grapefruit kits. not sexy at all. Hi-Liter pink.
2771	@handle - i was thinking tangerine....but grapefruit works.
2771	Barca v Xerez on ESPN2 right now. Barca should win this match by 4 goals. Xerez is bottom of the table in LaLiga. Barca is # 1. We'll see.
2771	@handle - I finally finished the book. An enjoyable and educational read. The epilogue...amazing. THANK YOU.
2771	@handle - likewise! We're both operating from what we know. Curious to get your take on this.
2771	@handle - The break in Lyn Collins - "Think", Baltimore club staple. That break was used in dnb, but not nearly as much in bmore club.
2771	@handle - The answer, bmore. I don't know much about dnb, but i do know The Winstons - 'Amen Brother' is the backbone for dnb & jungle.
2771	@handle - (For those that are wondering) Lyn Collins - Think: -> http://bit.ly/6eiICa
2771	@handle - well done.
2771	Sylvia Striplin - You Can't Turn Me Away. Give it a listen...you know the sample. http://bit.ly/6q5IJt
2771	Before Bowden, Lee Corso & Burt Reynolds were it. W/BB, Deion Sanders & Warrick Dunn brought top 5 rankings to FSU. Bowden deserved better.

5198	@handle I was wondering when he was gonna show up! Are we as EMERSONIANS allowed to see the show? or is it only for the rich folk?

1121	Sounders Cribs.... Enjoy your tour of out Starfire facilities! http://bit.ly/S8X34
1121	RT @handle: No disrespect to @handle, but I'm Sounders Till I Die! Vote @handle in TPL: http://ow.ly/v7V4 #TPL
1121	The stars were aligned last night for Seattle. Today, not so much for the Seahawks. We should find a way to remedy this...
1121	So what does everyone think??? Who is going to get the game winner tonight in the Sounders Kansas City game??? I'll take Jaqua...
1121	Why does it bother me so much in emails when people use to/two/too incorrectly? Does that make me a huge nerd? If so, I am ok with it....
1121	Weeding and fertilizing my lawn before the US match. I should hire a rookie to do this...
1121	Speedy recovery to Charlie... can't wait to see your 9th min tribute. And good luck to the US Men...
1121	This is what injured players do when the team is away... http://bit.ly/13LJwt
1121	Back to training after the weekend off. Got to train "almost" all-in for the first time in 6 weeks. So fun. Still excited about the US Nats!
1121	VOTE FOR ME: http://ow.ly/tWap RT @handle: Twitterverse Players League - Group H: @handle @handle @handle @handle #TPL
1121	Weekend off for the team. Allows us to focus on the Honduras match tomorrow. I can already smell South Africa (in a good way)...
1121	Hosted 'Cribs' at the Starfire facilities today. Keep your eye out for it online. Wait till you see what I planted in a couple lockers!
1121	RT @handle: If Drew Carey Reaches 100k Followers By Nov. 9th He'll Donate $100,000 To Fight Cancer. Follow @handle TODAY! PLS RT!
1121	@handle the young boy in the Open Cup pics is Will, someone Sigi has known since his UCLA days, and has always brought him good luck.
1121	Yoga and physical therapy this morning.. All you can eat sushi lunch with Roger, now brainstorming for a "roaring 20's" outfit. Suggestions?
1121	I think tetherball is one of the more underrated sports. Should it only be played during 4th grade recess??? I think not...
1121	Roger, aka the homeless man from Seattle, shines as the hero! So happy for the boys. A la Black Eyed Peas, tonight's gonna be a good night!
1121	Team away to Columbus, injured guys holding down the fort here in Seattle. Despite my effort, the stationary bike will not move....
1121	Just saw the replay of Farve's pass against SF. Pretty amazing. Tyrone Marshall is lucky to still be in our team survivor pool!
1121	Visited Puesta del Sol School today in Factoria and spoke to the 2nd and 5th grades. Spanish Language Schools are pretty amazing!!!
1121	Tough weekend for Seattle Sports... Sounders, Seahawks! At least Stanford got a victory over UW... sorry Huskies.
1121	Two things I hate about yesterday's game. Losing, and seeing players get injured. I hope Ralston's knee is not that bad.
1121	TGIF... one more day till another big game. Might as well be in the playoffs already.
1121	Check out Roger's horrible singing. And to hear my banter with Seba about his eating habits, click on "renew". http://bit.ly/EUI7r
1121	Roger Levesque and Yoda flaunting their spirituality and hair game. http://bit.ly/11pQJG
1121	Nothing worse than watching training. Injury is progressing, but never as fast as I would like. But stationary bike skills are peaking!!!
1121	Swimming in the Snoqualmie River in Sept... have to love this weather, and days off!
1121	mackmartinpr: http://pic.gd/a6fa70 - Check out the new Seattle Sounders FC Zune HD (also available for other lesser MLS clubs - but why?)
1121	Just home from Chivas game. Carrying the US Open Cup Trophy with me. Taking it to Pacific Place pro shop tomorrow from 2-3pm. Come c it.
1121	Just had my routine game day French Toast, despite being hurt. Think the Seattle rain could be a good omen for today's game. Come on boys!
1121	@handle. Ethan and Tommy Clark both got Grassroots Soccer off the ground. Soccer can do a lot more than just entertain http://bit.ly/wlzDK
1121	Welcome @handle to Seattle. Go to Pike's Place at some point. But beware of fake photoshoots , like this one... http://bit.ly/fEFXp

1121	Pale is the new tan! Good thing I live in Seattle.
1121	In preseason Freddie L called me 'Tyler.' Keller thought this was funny. After training today I found a 'Tyler' 26 jersey in my locker. Wow!
1121	translated for Fredy Montero for his Sounders Insider interview today... keep your eye out for it!
1121	Sorry to see Seba go. He will have success wherever he plays. But this is the nature of sports and MLS that we cannot control.
1121	Just finished all day meetings with the other MLS Players Union Reps. LOTS of interesting stuff going on....
1121	@handle Come to the SCORES fundraiser Thurs 6-9 @ Fox Sports Grill & perform some Karaoke I heard about from Ozzies! Or was it J Smith?
1121	Fundraiser Thurs 6-9 pm Fox Sports Grill downtown for SCORES. AMAZING items for auction. Come have a drink with me, and players from MLS!
1121	I am completely absorbed/mildly addicted to Word Scramble. Pretty fun. It's best on iphones.
1121	Excited for the convergence of the nation's soccer community in Seattle next weekend. Would rather be playing than a fan, but so it goes.
1121	RT @handle: 1 million followers by end of 2009 for @handle to get 1 million dollars. Then on Jan 1st you can unfollow me if u want.

9148	@handle -- To answer your D/ST question, you really can't lose with either NO or BALT ... both are playing HORRIBLE TEAMS (go w/ Ravens)
9148	@handle -- Titans rookie WR Kenny Britt may be a great Gage replacement -- and a better alternative to T.O. at this point ...
9148	@handle -- No worries. Those 3 rants were not intended for anyone in particular ... I just hate defensive questions, in general ...
9148	@handle -- I would not drop Donald Brown for ANY Redskin right now ... unless you REALLY A NEED a 4th-string WR, hold on to D-Brown
9148	Here are today's Thursday Revelations/Fantasy Clicks ... enjoy! http://tinyurl.com/yj4cqwe
9148	@handle -- Change of plans: Justin Gage has "multiple" broken bones in his back ... you might wanna NOT pick him up for the time being ...
9148	@handle -- Then go Brady over Peyton ...
9148	@handle -- I'd rank your WRs 1)Austin 2)Jennings 3)Holmes 4)Boldin for Week 10 ... thx!
9148	@handle -- Do you actually have Peyton AND Brady? If so, does it really matter?
9148	@handle -- Celek over V-Davis (barely) ... thx!
9148	@handle -- I'd rather have LT/Crabtree over D-Jax, if that's what you're asking ... (but it's very, very close)
9148	@handle -- If you REALLY want AP, you'll have to surrender 1 Tier 1 RB/1 Tier 1 WR/1 Tier 2 RB/WR ... it's got to be a 3-for-1
9148	@handle -- You ride Ronnie and Forte in Week 10 ... unless you know for sure Westbrook won't play (and we don't know that as of Thursday)
9148	@handle -- I'd start Dustin Keller over Heap in Week 10 ... in fact, I have that exact same scenario in one of my 10 leagues ... thx!
9148	@handle -- If T.O. is the worst WR on your roster, then dump him for Gage ... and I'd drop Felix's balky knee over Choice to get Betts
9148	@handle -- I shouldn't be disrespecting Cedric -- who's been amazing this year -- but I think Mendenhall has a better game in Week 10
9148	@handle -- For your two flex spots, let's ride Welker and SidRice over Witten, V-Davis, M-Barber and Reggie Bush .. thx!
9148	@handle -- I'd start Calvin over Boldin in Week 10 ...
9148	@handle -- WITHOUT knowing who's on your team or which twosome you'd be getting ... I'd rather have AP/Palmer over Peyton/K-Smith, thx!
9148	@handle -- Your "should I dump Calvin" is wayyyy too vague ... who else ya got? Me personally, I am going to ride him every week ...
9148	@handle -- OH, HOW I LOVE ANSWERING DEFENSIVE QUESTIONS ... WHAT FUN!!!! Sarcasm aside, Bengals long-term ... Fins this week!
9148	For those who haven't read today's Clicks ... I cover rankings for QBs/RBs/WRs/TEs ... http://tinyurl.com/yldfr34
9148	@handle -- Use your RB depth to make trades ... slaton to moats' owner ... mccoy to westbrook's ... sell Portis/ & Betts ... BE CREATIVE!
9148	@handle -- Part 1 -- I'd start Romo over Cutler (barely) ... Part 2 -- Yes, drop Knox for Greene ...
9148	@handle -- V-Davis ... http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/fantasy/11/11/wednesday.clicks/index.html
9148	Here are today's Fantasy Clicks -- literally HOT OFF THE PRESSES!!!! http://tinyurl.com/yldfr34
9148	@handle -- Eh, I'd probably want the Palmer/Jennings end -- but it's close!
9148	@handle -- I just sent 'em to New York ... which means they'll probably be on the site by 3 p.m. ... thx!
9148	@handle -- Once again, I'm not a big fan of vague questions ... what are your other options, should you choose to dump Portis?
9148	@handle -- I would rather have Mendenhall/Bowe over Carolina's Steve Smith/P-Thomas ... due to the Chiefs' easy-cheesy sked coming up
9148	@handle -- Yes, I would definitely surrender Palmer for Addai -- in a nanosecond! ... as for your RBs, start Peterson and Beanie ...
9148	@handle -- With your current roster, I would most certainly give up P-Rivers to get back CedBenson/Carson in return ... boom!
9148	@handle -- I'd rank your RBs like this for Week 10 -- 1)J-Stew 2)Hightower 3)Fargas 4)F-Jackson ... thx!
9148	@handle -- It's not a blowout ... but I'd rather have Fitz/Felix over Wayne/Reggie Bush in a standard-scoring league ... PPR? maybe not
9148	@handle -- Dude, did you seriously ask if you should dump an extra kicker for darren sproles? I oughta ban you from here for asking that
9148	@handle -- For Gates/Flacco in a keeper ... you'd probably get someone like ryan grant, p-thomas, mendenhall, knowshone, LT, barber, etc.
9148	@handle -- That question is too broad ... I need specifics to your personal situation...
9148	@handle -- I will NEVER pass up a chance to improve my team before the deadline (no exceptions) ... but I could be happy with your RBs ..
9148	@handle -- Uh, Fitz and the Cards have the easiest playoff-sked BY A COUNTRY MILE ... l'd side with Larry ...
9148	@handle -- That's rather vague ... do I like him as a No. 4 RB? yes ... a No. 2? no ... would I kill myself to trade for him? Uh, no ...
9148	Here are the fantasyland Week 11 Revelations -- hot off the presses! (will re-post later for non-early risers) ... http://twurl.nl/a0o037
9148	@handle -- You are very welcome ... I appreciate the patronage!
9148	@handle -- Not eve Maroney or Slaton family members would pick their kin over Ray Rice and T-Jones in Week 11. ... there's your answer
9148	@handle -- If you want to go safe at the flex, go with 1)Charles 2)Burleson 3)Chambers ... if it's feast-or-famine, let's ride D-Mac ..
9148	@handle -- Looks to me like you've ALREADY decided to take that trade ... but yes, I'd rather have Ocho/Beanie over Addai/Cribbs
9148	@handle -- Boldin, Rice and Calvin ... thx!
9148	@handle -- I'm not thinking of Week 12, my man ... we'll address later
9148	@handle -- This is wayyyyyyyyyy too vague a question, my man ... should he be starting for you, that's all that matters????
9148	@handle -- As for your WRS ... let's ride Driver and Steve Smith ... thx!
9148	@handle -- Honestly, I think I'd rather take my chances on Devery Henderson ... but if I had to choose, I would probably go B-Marsh ...
9148	@handle -- Ummmm, I'd go with Sims-Walker over Hightower for your PPR in Week 11 ... thx!
9148	@handle -- I'd go Beanie over Lynch/LJ at RB ... at WR, let's ride Boldin & V-Jax over T.O., Braylon, Walter ... and thx for the patronage!
9148	@handle -- I have lost complete confidence in Lynch (so much that F-Jax is probably better ... but in your case, let's ride McCoy/MB3
9148	@handle -- It' s your lineup and your money. Ride that hunch!
9148	@handle -- If you absolutely, positively need a home run at the flex for Week 11 ... let's ride Devery over M-Bush, Fargas, Felix, Bryant
9148	@handle -- Oh goody, a defense question ... woo-hoo!!!! I'm taking the Saints, simply because NO has the more opportunistic D ...
9148	@handle -- SInce you had no follow-up questions from before, I will assume you liked Friday's Clicks ... thx for the patronage, as always!
9148	@handle -- Wow! When push comes to shove, I'm always starting Rodgers @ home (in good weather) ... and let's ride Austin at the WR slot
9148	@handle -- Shouldn't you be asleep by now? GameDay starts in, what, 6 hours!!! Damn!
9148	@handle -- For Week 11, I'd rank your flex RBs like this: 1)McCoy 2)F-Jax 3)Betts 4)Forsett ... although it's razor-thin between all 4 ...
9148	@handle -- I would rank 'em in the exact order you wrote: 1)Mendenhall 2) SidRice 3)Jacobs 4)Steve Smith (NYG) and 5)B-Scott for Week 11
9148	@handle -- First of all, you can't go wrong either way ... both are locks for 275 yards and/or 3 TDs ... but I'd play Warner over Brady!
9148	@handle -- For your PPR, I'd rank your Week 11 WRs like this: 1)Moss 2)Rice 3)Housh 4)Holmes 5)Burleson ... thx!
9148	@handle -- I'd rather have Hasselbeck over Palmer (barely) ... either one would be an upgrade though
9148	@handle -- I've been condemning Flacco for a while ... given the Ravens' Rice-reliance and the upcoming slate of cold-weather games
9148	@handle -- What? Are you saying that you ask the same question to 4-5 different "experts" every week? Sacre bleu! (Seriously ... thx!)
9148	@handle -- For your flex option, I'd go 1)McCoy 2)Betts 3)F-Jax 4)Forsett ... thx!
9148	@handle -- Maroney vs. T-Jones ... really? REALLY? What's with all the T-Jones hatred?
9148	@handle -- OOO, tempting ... but I think I'd rather go the S-Jax route ...
9148	@handle -- I'd rank your Week 11 RBs like this: 1)Moreno 2)Grant 3)Forsett
9148	@handle -- I'm just telling you how I would do it ... Crabtree's breakout is imminent ... and he's a low-risk play against Walter
9148	@handle -- No matter the situation, I'm riding T-Jones and P-Thomas in Week 11 (over Bernard Freaking Scott) ... thx!
9148	@handle -- I don't do the weekly projections (I have enough on my plate) ... but I would rather have Breaston over Santana in Week 11
9148	@handle -- This is pretty easy, actually ... let's ride Crabtree and Burleson (who LOVES playing his old team) over Olsen & Walter
9148	@handle -- Thanks, I have enough TVs ...
9148	@handle -- Yes, I think I would gladly take S-Jax for B-Marsh and LT in a PPR league -- especially if Orton is out for 1-3 weeks ...
9148	@handle -- I'd go J-Maclin over your three TEs for Week 11 ... and yes, the Friday Clicks are already out ... thx!
9148	@handle -- During crunch time, I'm going to ride Addai over the Cincy backs ... just pray for 40 receiving yards and a goal-line TD ...
9148	@handle -- I think I'd choose Slaton over Betts in Week 11 (misspelled your Twitter ID the first time -- sorry)
9148	@handle -- I think I'd choose Slaton over Betts in Week 11 .. thx!
9148	@handle -- Have I not mentioned you before? OK, I'll get to you on Wednesday -- PROVIDED you send me a Week 12 lineup question ...
9148	Here are Friday's Fantasy Clicks/Thursday Revelations ... hot off the presses! http://tinyurl.com/ylbnacu
9148	@handle -- Test my skill? Test my skill? 1)Knowshon 2)Grant 3)Caddy ... BOOM!
9148	@handle -- I would want Peyton/AP over McNabb/C-Johnson ... perhaps one of the best last-minute blockbusters you'll ever see ... thx!
9148	@handle -- I'd go Jacobs over Bernard Scott ... and Breaston over Lee Evans in Week 11 (although I love Evans vs. JAX, too) ... thx!
9148	@handle -- I answered the Beanie/Hightower/Slaton question in today's Clicks (to be published shortly on SI.com) ... thx!
9148	@handle -- I think I'd prefer the Calvin/J-Stew side, compared to the Sidney Rice (and whatever you'd find on waivers) duo ... thx!
9148	@handle -- MSW is AVERAGING 6 catches/113 yards/1 TD in home games this year ... I think the choice is clear ... especially against Walter
9148	@handle -- I understand your Barber devotion ... but I'm always going to ride the hot hand (R-Bush -- 5 TDs in 5 games) during crunch time!!
9148	@handle -- If it's a PPR league, ride Housh ... and if it's a standard-scoring one, hmmmmm ... I think I would go Jacobs (by a nose), thx!
9148	@handle -- My Fantasy Clicks come out every M/W/F ... and I do a REVIEW of each 'League' episode every Wednesday ...
9148	@handle -- I'm just telling you what I'd do ... you're under no obligation to follow the advice ...

5541	@handle This website sites the National Council on Problem Gambling as saying ~4% of all gamblers. http://bit.ly/6PdE7
5541	@handle In other words, taking away casinos ignores the root of the problem, which is what needs to be addressed.
5541	@handle The majority of people who gamble do not have gambling problems. Should we ban McDonalds because some people have eating problems?
5541	And I don't buy the casinos bring crime argument. At least not a significant amount.
5541	@handle Maybe that's the point. Apple is here to annihilate us all.
5541	@handle Not sure how I feel. I'll probably watch next week to make up my mind, but the acting sucks and there's too much lame commentary.
5541	Very poorly disguised universal healthcare jab on #V .
5541	@handle Maybe you are. There's plenty of movies and TV shows out there that are weak variations of the same thing. Why not plays?
5541	@handle Apparently my best friend was the crazy Jeopardy dude's camp counselor
5541	@handle That's actually what I was thinking about when I posted that.
5541	Would anyone in the OU administration do something like this? I've seen nothing to make me think so. http://bit.ly/13bJ6I
5541	@handle I see. I'm sorry. Hope you can get back to sleep. Maybe some tea would help?
5541	@handle Probably not. I can barely play it on guitar. But maybe eventually. I thought you were going to bed?
5541	Peter Frampton's "Penny for Your Thoughts" has to be one of the coolest acoustic guitar songs ever.
5541	@handle Aww. That's probably my fault. I woke up with a scratchy throat this morning. Hope you feel better.
5541	@handle Thanks for ruining my reputation on Twitter. ;-)

1416	@handle ...what do you mean?
370	Link to Carville sketch - jump to 3:25. http://bit.ly/DiXTe
370	wait for it.... wait for it...
370	"Nobody puts baby (or insert councilman name) in a corner."
370	Coucilmen have complained about being cornered into tax increase so if you hear the following statement you must drink everything...
370	Drinking game for today's city council meeting? What do you think? One critical rule will follow but not sure if there will be more rules.
370	Also, waiting for the first person to criticize the mayor because the person hired worked at HDR at one point in her life.
370	Money for position came from a grant to be used for energy efficiency/conservation. Can't be used for street repairs. Get facts straight.
370	It's funny seeing people criticize Suttle for the sustainability coordinator hire. Job was posted on city website before Suttle was elected
370	@handle So, you're saying there was a failure of leadership from Festersen and Stothert?
370	Council has approved a budget! Festersen and Stothert voting no. No explanation from Festersen on "no" vote.
370	Jerram lecturing city council members - it's rather amusing and somewhat pertinent. You can tell he's a lawyer.
370	Congratulations Omaha - after 7 plus hours your council has not produced a budget.
370	Looks like we may be getting closer to a budget.
370	Jerram is filibustering. Vegas oddsmakers are starting to re-think odds. Jerram may be the darkhorse in boiling over.
370	@handle only if you're a lawyer - are you still there? who's leading in bathroom breaks?
370	Who will reach the boiling point first? That is the question on the table. Vegas oddsmakers have Thompson out in front.
370	Phrase of the day... "Omnibus bill" - legislation accepted in a single vote which contains many laws or amendments
370	Local access channel was just interrupted with kids yelling. This may have caused a heart attack with older viewers.
370	Brooowwwwn…Oh Buster Brown. Don’t let the council get you down. Don’t let Ben Gray make you frown. Ohhhh Buster Brown.
370	Buster Brown decided to shoot a councilman.
370	Oh Buster Brown had lived an ordinary life. Two kids, a dog, and a cautionary wife. While it was all going according to plan.............
370	Looks like there is back room dealing going on in the back room or they are discussing dinner plans.
370	Does anyone think Garry Gernandt looks like George Segal from "Just Shoot Me" http://www.zimbio.com/George+Segal
370	I'm back and the marathon city council meeting continues. What did I miss?
370	Btw, I meant director not directory. Long day. Schedule is not allowing for council meeting viewing.
370	Pete Festersen talks awfully fast. Slow down, take a breath.
370	Sorry to all the loyal followers expecting budget proposal drinking game and live tweeting. I'll try to make it up to you all somehow.
370	@handle Actually, no, raises didn't cause the pension mess. Other concessions did. U should know, you were in office when it happened.
370	Interesting, just discovered this new political blog in Omaha - www.omahablog.com - I'm disappointed in the boring name though.
370	It's over and I'm drunk. Back to work driving school kids around. I'm kidding; I'm a pilot.
370	Think I just saw American Tea Bag Lady! She's an @handle favorite!
370	Yes, we are getting some hecklers. Lady points out all the things the govt runs - defense, education, etc. and Latina woman & others heckle
370	@handle Probably at work.

2523	@handle Oh Im sure @handle didn't mean to make me cry it's just after an epic night of being bullied by that Fluffy thing and then
2523	@handle Many of my tweeter friends came to my aide and helped me through it. But I can see a sweetness in you that is real.
2523	@handle Well it seems that you and @handle will make a lovely couple. I am so happy for you both!
2523	@handle Yeah they make fun of me for fun. Thats what bullies always do. But I have blocked them. End of story.
2523	@handle Makes me feel bad & like being picked on picked on by school bullies. But I just want to focus on the positive things -
2523	@handle I don't talk to Fluffy to tell you the truth. She likes to make fun of me and call me names.

1193	@handle Hence why Isaac = the best, I CAN ALWAYS TELL HIS VOICE APART!! (Joking...maybe;))
1193	@handle Zac is the higher harmony on the 3rd. It's always hard to tell though! Tay/Zac are hard to tell apart sometimes.
1193	@handle I think Isaac does the first, Taylor does the second, and Zac joins on the third w/Tay, Ike is holding the note the whole time &

8463	Taking up @handle Twitter challenge. Prepare to be schooled @handle!
4412	Do you ever wish you could undo the stupid bonehead mistakes you've made, esp. the ones that cost you 7 months of your life?
4412	@handle Awesome! Now I have to ask: where in tx? I'm in Dallas & I would hate for those eggs to spoil on the drive down to Austin, say!
4412	@handle well, I will seriously make you some so you better get ready!;)
4412	@handle u know, I've been told I make the best deviled eggs ever so...(I've never understood that. It's not like it's hard!) ;)
4412	I can't believe my ex's...whatever you want to call her, had the nerve to call me. As if I would have anything to do w/ that loser now!
4412	I'm in a meeting, 3 hours long so far, with a principal and her staff. Someone please shoot me in the head...
4412	@handle Well since u guys were going w/ song lyrics & such, I was thinking a particularly apropos name would be "The Wet Dreams"! ;)
4412	Cop in an unmarked car. Red light turns green. He doesn't move. I honk. He flashes his lights. Am I supposed to be impressed?
4412	By the way, there's a guy in a car behind me chewing gum so hard he looks like a toothless cow chewing beef jerky!
4412	I love when there's a low layer of fog hovering just above the ground in fields & such on cool, brisk mornings like this...:)
4412	This dude just walked into the auto repair shop that looks like a perfect cross between Dave Grohl & Hugh Laurie. Random...
4412	I guess if I'm hurt, angry, sad or frustrated, I'm not allowed to express it b/c it's too annoying to those around me thx to my past. Huh...
4412	@handle yeah, my brother sent me that and I was literally crying I was laughing so hard!
4412	http://twitpic.com/p2ntb I'm sorry, but this made me laugh in a way it probably shouldn't have...
4412	Why is it when a random memory of someone u desperately want to forget invades ur headspace, u just want to smack someone...hard?
4412	It's the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. It's also the Incredible Hulk, Lou Ferrigno's b-day. R the 2 somehow related?! :)
4412	I just sat thru the worlds longest funeral procession! I freakin' lost count after 304 cars! Jeez!
4412	@handle Wow! I didn't realize that! I remember watching it as a kid & it was amazing! (Of course now I feel really old! Thx Gavin!) ;)

4412	I'm an educated woman. So how wrong is it that I'm sitting here watching one of those Naked Gun movies...& cackling?
4412	I have to train 200 people on child abuse and teen dating violence today. Oh joy...
4412	@handle So I had this dream that you covered this song: http://bit.ly/1NfKB2 It was breathtaking & I thought, "what if...?" ;)
4412	@handle That's very cool! We're so excited for you! Adrianne wants to know when we're going to get to meet Danny Glover! ;)
4412	@handle You two make magic, ok? ;) lol! Be good!
4412	I love having to drive other people's cars. Esp. when it's covered w/ political crap I find loathesome & is diametrically opposed to mine.
4412	Can my day get any shittier?
4412	Apparently I'm selfish & ungrateful. Maybe I wouldn't react that way if I didn't have a fractured vertebrae jamming into my spinal cord!
4412	$2500 for a new transmission? Seriously? Someone shoot me now...
4412	@handle Hope that didn't involve crying like a baby like my day of introspection did!
4412	It's a freakin' beautiful day in Dallas. Not a cloud in the sky. That must explain why the homeless guys by my office are so frisky...
4412	Uh, why did a homeless dude who appeared to be in his mid 70's just hit on me & ask me out? Man, I have some kind of animal magnetism! Jeez.
4412	@handle Have fun! And don't forget your, uh...box! ;)
4412	@handle See, I never even thought small penis. What does that mean? I'm tempted to insert some penis size cliche here, but...;)
4412	@handle NO YOU DIDN'T! --shaking my head--Billy, you need a serious spanking for that!!!
4412	http://twitpic.com/ntrcg Ok, I know it's oh so wrong, but how freakin' cute is my dog?!
4412	@handle I'm sorry...I feel ya...Happy B-day anyway though!

5439	@handle Yeah the beginning of the end of leftists in power. We will turn this around
5439	@handle Good for you! We all need to get involved now.
5439	@handle This is worse than Carter, Carter was a moron these people know what they are doing and they are going to destroy 233yrs of work
5439	Judgment Day is November 2, 2010 May God and the American voter teach the Democrat leftists that evil always loses.
5439	@handle What? what are you talking about?
5439	@handle No not the bill, the unrest. People are sick of it all. The taxes the lying the elitists spending our money. If 2010 is not a win?
5439	@handle Yep. Idiots, we can tear it down just like they put it up and that will be the prerequisite of our 2010 candidates!
5439	@handle You obviously do not see what is going on! I am not the only one noticing what is going to happen. Wake up and drink your coffee!
5439	@handle Not even close to over.
5439	@handle Damn right! This isn't over. They are slapping themselves on the back now, but we are going to show them one way or another
5439	Either a nationwide strike or grab the guns and the bible and go forth.
5439	If this health bill passes the semate we should have a nationwide strike. Every Conservative on strike would shut everything down.
5439	It's going to be historic alright. It will be historic when an entire party gets voted into the minority for one vote.

5439	@handle @handle Leftist values do not allow for free thought no matter how much they lie and say they do. You need us & we need you
5439	@handle @handle Christian conservative values allow for liberals and non-believers to exist among us in harmony.
5439	@handle @handle I understand that. However you the country was founded on christian conservative values.

5439	if the leftist are not stopped what will be the tipping point where everyday americans are willing to go to jail to stop the tyranny
5439	@handle if it gets that bad itll be too late. civil unrest will happen before that
5439	@handle if not we are going to have another civil war. Totalitarian style socialism will never work here
5439	@handle i agree Conservatism is easily articulaed once you can get someone to think logically rather than emotionally
5439	its amazing that when asked none of the lawmakers supporting this can explain the constitutionality of gov health care
5439	@handle lets hope its only a war of words that are needed to stop this
5439	the 111th Congress and the President are breaking the law with gov health care
5439	there is nowhere in the constitution that allows for gov health care
5439	The constitutionality of gov health care is nonexistent in every aspect not just the purchase requirement
5439	@handle not easily done when taxes are taken before get your check.
5439	morons like @handle know not what they support
5439	@handle yeah and china n. Korea and Cuba are bastions of freedom. you really are a moron. ppl like you are anti-American
5439	@handle you are a fool to believe leftists have your liberties in mind. smaller gov is the only answer.
5439	if Texas secedes they just send troops there what then?
5439	I say a nationwide strike would be the first step. 50 to 75 million conservatives on strike would stop the economy for the gov.
5439	is there going to be another civil war because of this? this is only going to get worse.
5439	every other socialist/communist country has failed why do people believe this will work?
5439	What is going to happen if the gov. strips our liberties? just lay down and die?
5439	These people are going to destroy our country. when are people going to wake up.

5439	@handle if that happens you will suffer along with the rest of us. You still have not seen the light. Educate yourself!
5439	@handle This has nothing to do with Bush. Obama is trying to destroy the country to ensure eternal power for leftists.
5439	@handle get used to Americans being more educated and rejecting leftists like Obama and you. Liberty will prevail. #thepatriotjournal

9577	#f1 #f1app #iphone New pack for Qualifying has been posted with data to the end of session. To download "Clear Local store" in settings.
9577	@handle Maybe, but there has to be a commercial market for it. If the Palm Pre takes off...
9577	@handle Unusual session for us meant we had to tweak our setup. You needed to change the session back to Qualifying in setup. Sorry
9577	#f1 #f1app #iphone ... select the right session using the setup screen.
9577	@handle Just a spin
9577	@handle Try our official one!
9577	#f1 #f1app #iphone Qualifying to being in 15 mins. Lets hope the rain does cause too many dramas!
9577	#f1 #iphone #f1app Practice 3 posted.
9577	#f1 #f1app #iphone P3 delayed because medical chopper cannot take off...
9577	@handle Heh. Well we'll be there rain or shine!
9577	#f1 #f1app #iphone Getting ready for Practice 3 in 15 mins...
9577	@handle Thankyou! Glad you like our app! Please leave us a nice review in the appstore, and look out for the next season coming soon...
9577	#f1 #f1app #iphone Practice 2 race pack is now available for download. Enjoy and see you again for P3!
9577	@handle Thankyou. Glad you like it! We may take you up next season on that... ;)
9577	#f1 #f1app #iphone P2 about to begin in Brazil!

9577	#f1 #f1app #iphone Brazil test looking good - there ya go guys you can have your app back ;)
9577	@handle Sorry, we're only on iPhone and ipod at present, but we are a unique way to watch F1.
9577	@handle Yes, unfortunately we're only on the iPhone. Check http://bit.ly/RB78B to see more about it.
9577	#f1 #iphone New F1 Timing App CP End of season promotional price - http://bit.ly/22mrz1
9577	@handle Yes this is what the session packs are for. tap the time and pause the race, and tap again to restart. Also can use start time setup
9577	@handle Sorry, went out for lunch! We're trying ;)
9577	@handle Note race start is the time the lights go *green* not 1pm after warm up lap (normally more like 1.03pm).
9577	@handle The problem is you need to know when the race starts. After that is set, it will always be in sync. #f1
9577	@handle It can already do that, but you need to know the race start time. Set the start time to the session start and go to race #f1
9577	#f1 #iphone #f1app Race pack will be available from 8:10 +1 hr (BST)
9577	@handle Unfortunately yes. 2010 will be a whole new app. Pricing and availability yet to be announced...
9577	@handle I@handle Tweet us how you get on. In the UK works fine ok over GPRS
9577	@handle If you like our app please leave us a review
9577	@handle not at the moment, but we are watch for an appropriate way to do it...
9577	@handle no.
9577	@handle Wince isn't on our radar at the moment. Nice hardware, but market not. Personally had bad consumer exp 2 yrs ago (crashes)
9577	@handle We give a limited number of codes to journalists, but each has to be vetted (we get quite a lot of requests). Email us details.
9577	@handle The starter pass will be released in a full pre season launch closer to the season. Current version for the already decided! #f1
9577	F1 2010 Timing App in the appstore http://bit.ly/89kbEo 2.1 version now shows news in app. #f1 #iphone #f1app
9577	@handle why thankyou! Leave us a nice review if it's not too much trouble!
9577	@handle We're looking at Blackberry, but the source is C, and currently Blackberry it appears Blackberry only supports Java.
9577	@handle Biggest is a race - about 4-5 meg. Practice and Qual come in around 2Meg. This year a little bigger than last, cos more ;)
9577	@handle Yes. Even better than that it should work fine over GPRS or where ever you have a data connection.
9577	@handle Sorry, the 2010 season is a new app. 2010 CP will give you full access to the 120+ hrs of sessions in 2010 though! #f1
9577	F1 2010 Championship pass now available - http://bit.ly/89kbEo Discounted before the New Year #f1 #iphone #f1app
9577	@handle You're not following so I cannot DM you ;). Not at the moment, though watch this feed for more info.
9577	@handle We're looking at the Symbian S60 devices, but we're still in proving stages. Watch this feed for updates!
9577	@handle We're investigating the feasibility of doing an Android version, yes. Watch this feed for more updates...
9577	@handle Thanks, UK data coverage in Oxford is rarely better than GRPS, so we said it must work with that!
9577	#f1 #iphone #f1app New version in review has an improved news reader that no longer quits. Sorry for not fixing this earlier...
9577	@handle yes. We have to pay the team of engineers, they get grouchy otherwise...
9577	@handle it is a new app for a new season. New features coming would break on 09 data.
9577	F1timing app 2010 is now available. Dicounted before new year, keep it up to date, new feature coming soon! #f1
9577	Hmm. iPod 8G 3G *is* different to the 2G. The screen seems very yellowy and seems flickery.Cheaper parts? Maybe I just have a bad one. #ipod
9577	@handle The app is being improved for 2010 - faster, smoother, better - work will be complete by the start of the season...
9577	Objective-C -> straight C = 6x performance, and 4 times less memory ;)
9577	@handle If you want to look at the 2009 championship, yes. Otherwise wait for the 2010 App which will be available before Christmas #f1
9577	@handle 2010 will be a whole new app. It will be in the appstore at Christmas, with a larger update before the beginning of the season
9577	#f1 #f1app #iphone - that's it we're out! Race will be packaged shortly! Thakyou everyone for watching our first season.Hope you enjoyed it!

9577	#f1 #iphone #f1app All set for Yas Marina Qualifying...
9577	#f1 #iphone Practice 2 session pack now available!
9577	@handle Yeah, looks like that doesn't it ;). The next point on was being reported as the start finish line, so a jump forward and back
9577	#f1app Problem with turns 15-16 will be fixed in next session.
9577	@handle Thanks Marco, didn't know that one! Glad you like the app!
9577	#f1 #f1app #iphone Practice 2 underway!
9577	@handle Try full restart of the phone (hold both buttons down 10secs). Sounds like the OS has pinched too much memory, and needs a reboot
9577	#f1 #f1app #iphone Currently we have a sequencing problem with our loops, around turn 15-16. Working to resolve it...
9577	@handle Yes we're looking at doing that.
9577	#f1 #f1app #iphone hope everyone has upgraded to 1.6 which has an improved Abu Dhabi map. Yas Marina deserves it! Stunning...
9577	#f1 #iphone #f1app Abu Dhabi Practice 1 begins in 10 mins!
9577	@handle Undecided, but running the practice sessions is an expense - in terms of run time they take more effort than the actual race!
9577	@handle Any time before christmas ;)
9577	@handle Possibly.
9577	@handle We'll watch the Pre, but in our view its not quite established enough yet.
9577	@handle we already support full replay, after the event, so you can sync to dvrs. #f1
9577	@handle The commercials are complex, so at present we're mobile only. In the future, who knows?
9577	@handle We're not actually game, we're mobile technical timing feed during the races. http://www.softpauer.com

6595	It's beginning to look like a 4-player logjam for the LF/DH spots in Texas. So far Byrd and Blalock are getting more ABs than Murphy/Jones.
6595	Wang v. Uehara matchup on Wednesday yielded ZERO strikeouts by the two starting pitchers. I can't believe that happens very often.
6595	Lineup lessons learned so far? Tony La Russa will tinker on a daily basis. Shocking! Read the April 7 Extract. http://tiny.cc/xPZFJ
6595	New Daily Extract is posted, pointing out surprises in Opening Day rosters. http://tiny.cc/50lcr
6595	Peeking at the lineups in tonights Atl/Phi game - no surprises. Jordan Schafer batting #8 is just confirmation, not a surprise.
6595	Definition of "Baker's Dozen" -- Number of fantasy teams on which I own Scott Baker. Aargh! (Shift everyone up one and add RA Dickey as #5)
6595	From Sabathia to Suppan on opening day: One small step for Jeff, One giant leap downward for the Milwaukee Brewers.
6595	Skip Schumaker to bat #9 vs. lefties and #1 vs. righties. That is downright weird.
6595	Some are calling it Devine-intervention. Brad Ziegler will be the closer in Oakland. If you picked him up cheap in your auction: Miraculous.
6595	Nah. We'll eat your $14,000,000 salary this year. Nah. We don't care that you are on the brink of 500 HR immortality. Bye bye, Gary.
6595	Despite my brilliant move of snagging J.A. Happ at auction for $1, the Phils are not playing along. Chan Ho Park will be the #5 starter.
6595	Score another win for the Netherlands: with Hochevar sent down, Sir Sidney Ponson has a chance to belly flop his way into the rotation in KC
6595	Gardner declared starting CF in NY. A new source of SB has entered the fantasy game.
6595	News that B. Morrow will close in Seattle will send Lowe, Batista, Aardsma, Corcoran, and Cordero to the wire in lots of fantasy leagues.
6595	Kris Benson may be in line for a rotation spot in Texas. Nice to see a Benson story without an annoying mention of Anna. Oh, sorry.
6595	Forget about Meet the Press and Face the Nation. I'll be watching Lou Piniella on Sunday to hear him explain why it's Gregg & not Marmol.
6595	Carlos Villaneuva will close in Milwaukee until either 1) Hoffman gets healthy or 2) the Curse of the Brewer Pen renders him ineffective.
6595	Girardi talks about a swap at the top of the Yankee's batting order: Jeter/Damon/Teixeira/Matsui/Nady/Posada/Cano/Ransom/Gardner
6595	Skip Schumaker will start at 2B for the Cardinals, say GM John Mozeliak. Who woulda thunk this would happen one month ago.
6595	Can you believe this? Saunders/Weaver/Moseley/Adenhart/Loux may be the rotation to begin the year in Anaheim. Tex would look good about now.
6595	Believe it or not, the Nationals rotation is beginning to look like this: Lannan/Olsen/Cabrera/Zimmerman/Martis.
6595	Before writing Dontrelle into the Tigers rotation based on 4 shutout innings against minor leaguers, consider IT WAS AGAINST MINOR LEAGUERS!
6595	Put me down for Franklin Morales as the fifth starter in Colorado. Making it Cook/Jimenez/Marquis/de la Rosa/Morales.
6595	The definitive proof that left-handedness by itself is a great asset is the continued talk that Horacio Ramirez will be a SP in Kansas City.
6595	With Scott Lewis announced as #4 starter in Cleveland, here is how the rotation shapes up: Lee/Carmona/Pavano/Lewis/Reyes.
6595	Micah Owings appears to have #5 rotation spot sewed up in Cincinnati, making for a tasty rotation: Volquez/Harang/Arroyo/Cueto/Owings.
6595	The Yankee CF battle is an interesting one. Gardner is making a solid case this spring. Melky has always struck me as a fourth outfielder.
6595	Mike Redmond is the #1 catcher in Minnesota until further notice. Who really knows if Mauer will miss one week or three months?
6595	Count on Shawn Hill to grab a spot in the Padres rotation.
6595	Just added myself to the http://wefollow.com twitter directory under: #baseball #mlb #lineups
6595	Scioscia says he is thinking of keep Howie Kendrick in the #2 slot in the batting order. That would be a big boost in HK's run totals.
6595	Chris Getz in as starting second baseman for the White Sox.. Nix to bench. Beckham to minors. http://tiny.cc/g2Ffm
6595	Blue Jays rotation suffers further insult. Janssen to start season in extended spring training or in the minors: http://tiny.cc/2EYtJ

1816	http://twitpic.com/n2j8d - Who's bad!? :D
1816	Here is a hint.. I totally just bought a pair of black skinny girl jeans and a leather jacket with chains.. :D
39	@handle Joooinnnnnn usssssssssss.
39	@handle This is why I'm glad I am a micro-manager. It means I can skip that skillset, and also stop the stoopid.
39	My hype and early AM playing convinced my other roommate to purchase L4D2. :P
39	Excellent, within a few hours of my contacting Gamefly via their website, they sent an apology and redacted the erroneous charges.
39	@handle Can't speak for MW2, but I'm enjoying AC2 so far. Much more refined than the first. No multiplayer, though.
39	Drooling at this page (http://bit.ly/2leOa4) My messenger is finally dying (though it lasted five years!).
39	@handle Assassin's Creed 2.
39	I like that Grasp is available from the beginning in AC2.
39	@handle I was just charged three times for a game I decided to keep. Hope we can remedy this?
39	@handle Was it perhaps taken down? Or is this something more tech-related?
39	Gamefly, I may have decided to keep the game I am currently renting, yes. But why are you charging me for it three times?
39	That was a nap I needed.
39	Every once in a while, instead of just shrugging off a complaint, I like responding with a comment that deflates the other.
39	Need to step away from the computer before I start yelling at my connection. Need to talk to roomie about whether the problem is the router.
39	@handle I wish I had invites. :-/
39	Which reminds me. Do people want a L4D2 and AC2 Wave? If so, who wants to be part of the discussion?
39	@handle Maybe after I play some more, Corvus and I can have public Twitter discussions about it. :P
39	@handle Sorry I dropped from our earlier game; my connection kept kicking me then having a fit-start, then kicking me, et cetera.
39	@handle Hard Rain is the most ridiculous. Sugar Mill has multiple witches roaming about.
39	-.- Comcast is like a lover of whom I know I should rid myself, but am addicted to staying.
39	Internet connection, of all the days to fuck up...
39	AC2. Il Dottore!
39	Gnome!
39	Did I mention I love Rochelle? Yay for more black female protagonists in games!
39	Katana? Decapitation of zombies? Excellent.
39	There's a lot to like about the attention to detail in L4D2. Take an adrenaline shot and notice how the sound effects change.
39	Of course my internet connection wants to act up tonight; of course. Sigh.
39	Yay! First game I'm Rochelle!
39	@handle Billy Corgan is also insane now.
39	L4D2 decrypting. Guess I should go pop in AC2 and let it install as well.
39	It's okay. I brought a book.
39	I'm so rarely around gamers that aren't friends who indulge with me discussing games. This? This is strange.
39	Then again, I know not what to expect at the end. Just a feeling I get.
39	I have a sneaking suspicion that I hampered some end-fight with allies with the decision I just made in DA:O. Made it anyway.
39	@handle Also, realize I do not have your Steam name. Mine is the same as this handle.
39	@handle I was thinking much the same. Glad I'm going to pick up AC2. Hopefully up when I get back.
39	Will go through first campaign, and then try AC2 for a bit.
39	After I pick up AC2, I believe I'll come back and play L4D2.
39	Made a decision based purely on the fact that I respect Shale; otherwise never a decision this character would make.
6512	@handle Amazon S3 is your best choice, IMO. Dirt-cheap, very reliable. Can use AllwaySync to back up.
6512	@handle 2 ATI Digital Cable Tuners, 2 Aver USB Volar HD for OTA (excellent), Silicon Dust HDHomeRun (interesting but flawed)
6512	@handle I'll be writing it up next week for ZDNet. I quit DirecTV back in Feb 2008 and haven't looked back
6512	@handle Old school ATI digital cable tuners
6512	@handle Have had them all for ages. Two ATI OCUR tuners, an HDHomeRun (2x), one Aver Volar USB
6512	Media Center relocated to the living room. Two cable tuners, 3 OTA HD tuners. Shockingly easy. Cable guy didn't have to do a thing.
6512	@handle Thanks! It's been one of my faves for years, perhaps because of the location, outside city hall Florence, Italy
6512	@handle With your cable company's help, yes. You still have to pair with their CableCARDs, but BIOS restrictions are gone.
6512	@handle I've seen lots of errors with Hotmail/Live accounts but none with POP/SMTP and Exchange
6512	@handle The server and client versions shown in your pic are correct
6512	@handle That's the right current version. Is there any other PC on the network with a lower version?
6512	@handle Are you using the Outlook Connector with web-based mail accounts?
6512	@handle Sounds like a router issue upstream from you. Have you tried a tracert to the domains in question?
6512	@handle What happened?
6512	@handle Look in Control Panel, Programs, for version number of HP MediaSmart Server Software. What is it?
6512	@handle I'm always embarrassed when I am on the wrong end of that equation. Have learned from experience to check before sending a DM
6512	michaelwolf Got your DM but can't respond because you don't follow me.
6512	@handle That might have fixed it. Chipset, storage drivers can cause the sort of errors you've been seeing
6512	@handle Do you have an Intel ICH8/9 SATA controller? If so, you need a new driver for it
6512	@handle Feel free to DM me if you want personalized help. Writing a post on how to troubleshoot these errors, so data is useful
6512	@handle I hear you re frustration. That is not normal behavior. You have a driver or HW problem that needs to be resolved.
6512	@handle To reset IE8 after Flash uninstall, Tools menu, Internet Options, Advanced tab, click Reset button
6512	@handle You have a bad add-in. Probably Flash. Uninstall Flash completely, then reset browser, reinstall. http://bit.ly/2mrj3Y
6512	@handle Actually, you've just described the Techmeme algorithm in full. ;)
6512	@handle No, your backups will remain, and when you reconnect everything will be there.
6512	@handle Sorry, I always react that way when I see a link to an interesting article that is behind a paywall.
6512	@handle On our next trip to Italy, we hope to see the Amalfi Coast and other parts of the south
6512	@handle I have to pay $79 to read more than a teaser? Thanks for the link, but no thanks.
6512	@handle No, that was taken in Firenze, in front of the old city hall (look at the shadow of David on the wall)
6512	@handle Do you recognize the location?
6512	@handle Isn't that the date SkyNet is supposed to become operational? ;)
6512	Why I don't follow the usual suspects RT @handle: Condensed version of my RSS feed. Blah blah blah Tablet. Blah blah blah Chrome.
6512	RT @handle: Copy Editor: “Why am I a journalist? I don’t even drink.”
6512	@handle I'll slink away now... Anyone know where the after party is?
6512	@handle Congratulations on the new job, Ray! Sounds like an exhilarating first week.
6512	@handle OK, then, one more, slightly different but still powerful: "Blind Willie McTell"
6512	@handle I still get goose bumps when I hear that. It's a true story, btw. William Zanzinger just died last year.
7902	Filming a video about the Technology Transfer Office's Mission on at SPAWAR Systems Center, Pacific.

4159	MERRY THANKSGIVING TO ONE AND ALL!!!
4159	Want to wish all a very safe & happy thanksgiving. I'm so grateful for my Tracie. Were it not for her I'd have nothing. It's true...
4159	The Embers are at Thirty's 2 tonight in Greensboro, NC @ 8pm! Start your Thanksgiving holiday off by having a drink with us!
4159	The Embers will be in Winston-Salem, NC at the Embassy Suites Hotel for a New Year's Eve Bash. www.twincityquarter.com for details!
4159	Gotta put new brake pads on the van today. Can't have the Fam rollin' around with bad brakes. Headed out to the parts store!
4159	17 hours after I started I wrapped...I may need to rethink my approach....think I'll sleep on it.
4159	When you normalize at the wrong time during the mastering process it just botches everything. So kids - don't do that or your songs won't go
4159	I'm totally whipped from CD mastering all day - almost finished. Normally would take my time & use really fresh ears. Don't have the time.
4159	Don't forget to pick up your new Embers Christmas album @ www.theembersband.net - I think you'll like it.
4159	I just realized thanksgiving is this week. MAN - I've been too busy...
4159	Our brand new Embers Christmas album now available. A perfect stocking stuffer or holiday gift. Pick one up at www.theembersband.net
4159	http://twitpic.com/qh94d - I wonder where the hunger goes? It's like it's just gone...
4159	The Embers 2nite at the Black Angus in Statesville, NC. Visit www.thembersband.net for details. Stop by for dinner & a show! A nice place...
4159	Pulled off at a truck stop to repair an issue with bus generator & saw one of Jaxson's teammates Zach. His Dad is also a coach. Nice people!
4159	Wound too tight - not enough time to even shower today. As much as I love this time of year, it seems I can't slow down enough to enjoy it.
4159	http://twitpic.com/qc2rl - This is good!!! Thank you Shooter & Dave for the invite...
4159	We just played one ass kickin' sorority semi-formal at Red's in Raleigh. The best party we've ever played here. One dude called me Sir - boo
4159	http://twitpic.com/q7gg9 - He seemed happy warming up the bass fiddle before the show. Not sure what happened.
4159	The sink is full & the living room's a mess - but MAN I'm so happy to be home! If I don't do anything else, I'm sleepin late! Nite All...
4159	Just leaving the venue from our first Christmas show of the season. Very happy with the showgram. Went well & crowd response was AWESOME!!
4159	Trying to remember lyrics to all the new Christmas tunes we're doing this year. Think I may need to plant a cheat sheet or two. 1st show 2nt
4159	Looking forward to our first Xmas show of the season tomorrow. We've yet to do a complete run thru. Maybe no one will notice! Nice crowd plz
4159	http://twitpic.com/q1g3f - Playing the huge Auto Show in Charlotte - this is my next vehicle. It's parked beside the stage!
4159	I'm about to go to bed. Been up for 24 hrs. Gotta leave for a show at 2p today. The Good news - the new Embers Christmas CD is complete...
4159	You wouldn't believe how much I have to do & with little time. I'll find a way.
4159	So much to do today. Gotta record vox and begin mixdown for new Embers Christmas album. Must complete rest session first!
4159	In description of a song - daminiciously groovifiable. SEE! It's so easy to use this word (daminicious)! Trac came up with this one...
4159	http://twitpic.com/pp0vv - We're at dinner with Tracie's Dad & Step Mom. She was surprised with a Mexican bday serenade!
4159	http://twitpic.com/poctn - My Tizzy B hangin' at the game with me! Ain't she cool!
4159	Game Over. Tired of $6.25 16 oz. beers. Liver needs more at a better rate! Decisions, Decisions...
4159	Wildman (featured in earlier photo) heaved a pile and had to leave! Now we can see a little better.
4159	"You know how sentimental I am. You know I like that kinda shit!" We've had a few drinks and are laughing our asses off! Ignore vulgar words
4159	So the boys & I gave Trac a new anniversary/wedding/40th/diamond for her birthday. I said, "I really hope you like it". She says......
4159	http://twitpic.com/pnmju - We shouldn't - but we are!
4159	http://twitpic.com/pnhi2 - My view at the Panthers game. Wildman & D. Williams are hard core fans!

2567	@handle That E72 thought has kept me from crying! ;^)
2567	My Nokia E71 got RAN OVER by a car. RIP. Best phone I ever owned.
2567	@handle Thats the same as *#7370#, to be used on non-booting phones. at again, it does NOT reformat C: on FOTA+UDP devices.
2567	@handle FOTA does its job well. But FOTA+UDP makes this sick phone a brick. NO WAY for user to recover. That should not happen.
2567	@handle I think the FOTA design should be able to account for application bugs. Thats the whole idea!
2567	I assume they will have a way to reload the full factory image. Not sure how to proceed going forward; the bug will kill the phone again.
2567	@handle Nope. The hard reset only deletes data/settings it knows about. cannot handle bugs/corruption.
2567	@handle did you see my blog entry?
2567	@handle Becase the reset just erases data it KNOWS about. the memory bug created unknown files that persist after the reset, or a re-flash
2567	@handle Have you seen this issue with Nokia FOTA? http://bit.ly/qxlOA
2567	Nokia's FOTA (Firmware Over The AIr) implementation is flawed. See why I think so: http://bit.ly/qxlOA

2567	@handle Steve, pretty sure s60 are ALL 3.3v. Even the original 3650 has a 3.7v battery in it.
