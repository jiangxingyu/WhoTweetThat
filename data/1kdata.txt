564	#treat is awesome, but #trick is more fun.
564	You can learn a lot about how people see you by how you're listed. For example, it seems that people feel strongly that I work at Twitter.
564	I'm not sure when I switched from reading books in bed just before going to sleep to checking email, but I don't think it's healthy.
564	Another headphones cable on the fritz. I need to buy these things in bulk.
564	@handle Get a magical parking card. http://bit.ly/zpKsH Available pre-tax through WageWorks.
564	Ok then. I'm just going to hold off for a little while and react to this later.
564	I'm beginning to think this day would have gone better if I had started it differently. Mainly if I'd skipped the getting out of bed part.
564	I just finished season one of The Tudors, and omg you guys--you'll never believe how it ends!
564	@handle Perhaps ideal for the undead.
564	It's a good thing I have this never-ending mountain of email to sort though. Otherwise waiting on these tests would be boh-rring.
564	I want there to be substantially less waiting in my day to day life.
564	Embroidery: cooler than you would think.
564	@handle called me a "pretty little hate machine". It made me blush.
564	"Don't cloud the wonder of this week with your little ...facts."
564	I block for misdirected @ replies.
564	@handle No. I would burn alive contentedly at my laptop without ever having heard the fire alarm.
564	Finally figured it out. There's only one escalator at this Bart station. It changes direction depending on the time of day.
564	I'm watching the shipping casualty of this move hasten to its doom from the tracking page. Poor little guy. He has no idea what he's in for.
564	@handle Wow. Just... wow.
564	Took a chance on some molasses clove cookies. Oh yeaaah, I live on the wild side. And it's tasty here.
564	@handle What timezone are you in? Because if being up at 11pm makes you an insomniac then... *pats your head*
564	@handle Yes, and then she loaned it to me. But I can assure you, we both knew what we were getting into.
564	Anyone who believes that you cannot judge a book by its cover has not seen the cover of this book: http://amzn.com/0373621353
564	The prospect of a new office on Monday fills me with the kind of hope that scares me. (That is, any.)
564	Just remembered my stressful dream. I sure hope @handle isn't mad at me still.
564	@handle Well, hello fellow moocher. Thanks for getting to it so quickly!
564	Today in cute: Cinder eats with his hands. Scoops up each piece of kibble with his paw and head tilted, daintily dishes it into his mouth.
564	Nothing will make you realize just how dumb something is as trying to explain it to someone else.
564	The one thing that USPS has on UPS, FedEx and all other carriers: the forwarding address.
564	"We sincerely appreciate your feedback. But please note, there is a 250 character limit. Max exceeded." Turns out I only needed four.
564	I'm going to be a full hour late to this thing. My only excuse? C'mon, it's Saturday.
564	Donated to a public artistic preformance for the first time in years. It was both striking and silent.
564	Thinking warm, congratulatory thoughts towards the people who made that thing happen. You know who you are.
564	@handle Never Forget.
564	Abandoned cat is abandoned. http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/pet/1451640811.html Please adopt or RT.
564	Alright, that's it. Today calls for cookies.
564	I need something to cheer me up from my somber contemplation. Oh, this economics book will do quite nicely. What? "Dismal" is realtive.
564	Wanted: a lightweight, fast, simple note taking web app that stores to the cloud and is on iphone. Note: omnifocus does not qualify AT ALL.
564	@handle That is exactly as it should be.
564	Whatever. It'll be like paypal. We'll just hire lots of laywers.
564	What ever happened to smelling salts anyway? Oh. "Ammonia gas is toxic in large concentrations for prolonged periods, and can be fatal..."
564	GENIUS money making idea: An alarm clock that involves smelling salts.
564	Alright you guys, I let you have your fun. But it's November--it's time to put the sun away now.
564	@handle I don't get the hate people have for Nickelback. Sure, they're poppy and derivative--but since when does that inspire such rage?
564	@handle Critical mass represents almost, but not quite everything that I hate about San Francisco.
564	@handle I get that all the time. I block the misguided souls so they no longer appear in my timeline. (Their updates, not their souls.)
3039	@handle Not a cool joke! I got pretty pissed for a split second! :)
3039	WOW! This morning has been a roller coaster! But I'm in such a great mood :D
3039	Feeling good. Just helped a little boy catch his runaway dog. :)

3039	:D! @handle RT @handle: @handle wow, uli is the luckiest man on earth. :)
3039	@handle You know, punching bags do punch back :) Hope your day gets better.
3039	@handle Some things just aren't meant to mix... and other are :D Like football and sex :D
3039	@handle It's got everything you need: football and sex :D
3039	@handle Thanks! :D If you need an extra body at your practices, let me know :) Just throwing it out there ;)
3039	@handle Hahaha! Thanks! Def look into it. It's tough, not your typical girlie league.
3039	@handle Couldn't make it, but I tried out last year and want to try out again. :)
3039	@handle Not at all :) I'm all for it!
3039	@handle That's interesting! It's all about relevance.
3039	@handle That would not be fun at all! Do you not like it?
3039	@handle Hell yea! I'm all pumped up now and want to go play!
3039	@handle "What" what?
3039	@handle Ohhhh. How'd it go? What did you discuss?
3039	A quick convo about the Lingerie Football League and I want to go hit a tackling dummy! Grrrrr!
3039	@handle Dude! You have to be wearing three shirts with all three collars popped! @handle @handle
3039	@handle Cool! Looking forward to meeting you in person! :D #SoFlaBlogUp
3039	RT @handle does anyone have a good pic from last night's @handle I can use 4 my column? full cred given (no pay)
3039	Looking forward to @handle's SoFla BlogUp Saturday! Who else is going?

3039	@handle He seems kind of cool 2 me... :P The scruffy look is a good 1 4 him. I just really hope it doesnt get out of hand @handle
3039	@handle I'm glad you didn't try to find out for yourself :)
3039	@handle Which lyric? My fave of his is "I'm not a businessman. I'm a business, man." :D
3039	Someone just told me it's Wednesday. I almost slapped them! Don't mess w/ my days of the week! My dad and bro come in tomorrow!

7736	@handle sounds good.
7736	@handle it says you have to update before I can play you.
7736	@handle sounds good. I might also be downtown tomorrow. That work?
7736	@handle I think it was just a mistake because it wasn't in either listing.
7736	@handle have you checked http://powermax.com or http://macpac.com? They might have one or two.

7736	@handle How did you finagle that? My house wants to know!!! (the fireman boot thing)
7736	@handle As long as you partition it "out of the box" you'll be ready to go when it is time.
7736	@handle Because it's "one and done" instead of "Really? Are you SURE? How about now?"
7736	@handle Lemme know when you're back. I'll forget! (:
7736	@handle Yeah not the nicest price. But if you are gonna, it's easier before you're all "moved in". Set up the partition and install later?

7736	@handle I read those to @handle. He replied: I believe some pies are made simply as whipped cream conveyances. Much like fries for ketchup.
7736	@handle I know it's wordy but I loved The Stand: Uncut. I think the Shining is tight and terrifying. But really, Needful Things.
7736	@handle I'm already suspending disbelief by going along with "let's change the songs we do at Sectionals EVERY TWENTY MINUTES!!" "YEAH!"
7736	@handle Have you read Needful Things? I overshot my bus stop by 50-something blocks when it all got good!
7736	@handle Did you actually say "A toad more specific" or did you typo that?
7736	@handle You are asking Twitter what Posterous is? I think a better website to ask would be Google.
7736	@handle What's wrong with your Denon receiver?
7736	@handle I only expect SUPER OBVIOUS ones. That's the only one I've caught so far since I don't pay attention for plot holes.
7736	#glee question: How is the all girl club gonna win at sectionals? Wasn't there some deal Will had to make to get enough guys to compete?
7736	I want homemade cookies. I don't mind the making, but I don't like to do it alone. Who wants to make cookies with me?

7736	@handle I have braved Black Friday crowds but generally only Kennewick size w/mom! Too much hype and this year I saw no amazing deals.
7736	@handle I'm glad! @handle got to see the Walt Disney Family Museum and he said it was REALLY cool, nice even if you aren't a Disnerd.
7736	@handle I use Google Reader so I just rock the mobile version for the most part. Highly functional since I'm not hardcore on my phone.
7736	@handle Please do. It's SO tasty! Also I like the Cartoon Art Museum and I bet the Walt Disney Fam Museum is amazing. Helpful?
7736	@handle I think you need to send me those recipes! In return I will give you some of the ones I have!
